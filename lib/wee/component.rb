    # Backtracking means that you can go back in time of the components' state.
    # Therefore it is neccessary to take snapshots of those objects that want to
    # participate in backtracking. Taking snapshots of the whole component tree
    # would be too expensive and unflexible. Note that methods
    # <i>take_snapshot</i> and <i>restore_snapshot</i> are called for those
    # objects to take the snapshot (they behave like <i>marshal_dump</i> and
    # <i>marshal_load</i>). Overwrite them if you want to define special
    # behaviour. 
    #
    # By default only the decoration chain is backtracked. This is
    # required to correctly backtrack called components. To disable
    # backtracking of the decorations, change method
    # Component#state_decoration to a no-operation:

    # component is neither rendered nor are it's callbacks processed

    #   The component to be called.

    # [+return_callback+]

    #
    # <b>How it works</b>
    # 
    # The component to be called is wrapped with an AnswerDecoration and a
    # Delegate decoration. The latter is used to redirect to the called
    # component. Once the decorations are installed, we end the processing of
    # callbacks prematurely.
    #
    # When at a later point in time the called component invokes #answer, this
    # will raise a AnswerDecoration::Answer exception which is catched by the
    # AnswerDecoration we installed before calling this component, and as such,
    # whose process_callbacks method was called before we gained control.
    #
    # The AnswerDecoration then invokes the <tt>answer_callback</tt> to cleanup
    # the decorations we added during #call and finally passes control to the
    # <tt>return_callback</tt>.
